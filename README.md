Smart Task Helper with AI
-----------------
A simple one-page web app that uses an LLM to break vague goals into clear, actionable steps.

Users enter an open-ended task (e.g. “get healthier” or “learn programming”), and the app generates 3–5 structured steps in real time. This project was built as part of a timed technical assessment to demonstrate prompt design, API integration, and clean front-end interaction in a single self-contained file.

Key concepts
------------
LLM prompting for structured outputs
Client-side API integration
Lightweight UI/UX for fast iteration
